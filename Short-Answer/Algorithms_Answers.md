#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) o(n) time => o(n*m)
    o(1) space


b) o(n^2)time
    o(1) space


c) o(logn) time   --> recursive
o(n) space
o(1)= it will take the same amount of time despite input size

## Exercise II

Thinking of using binary search alg

sort arr of floors

divide the arr in 2, 
if target is greater than middle go right
if target is less than mid
go left
do recursive algo
until the middle matches target
if not all floors will break egg regardless
